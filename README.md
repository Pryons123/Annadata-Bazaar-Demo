Annadata Farmer Marketplace (Test Site)
Annadata is a simple online platform demo designed to connect farmers and consumers for fair crop sales. It features separate account creation for farmers and consumers, crop listings showing farmer sellers, price stats, clear About Us and policy sections.

This is a static frontend-only website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to simulate marketplace functionality. No real accounts or transactions are processed. Price of products listed are purely for example purposes and do not reflect real market price

Open index.html in a modern browser to explore the site. It is ideal for testing and demonstration purposes.
